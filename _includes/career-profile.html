<div class="summary">

<p>I am a computational biologist living in Tallahassee, Florida. Born in New York, I spent most of my childhood in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where I remained until my undergraduate studies. I earned by Bachelor's and PhD at Florida State University (FSU), and have been running a bioinformatics core facility at FSU since then. My graduate training involved the analysis of chromatin structure dynamics in humans and maize using enzymatic probes of chromatin structure coupled with microarrays and sequencing. It was during this time that I self-trained in data analysis and programming in order to analyze microarray and sequencing-based chromatin structure data. Through the process of self-training, I developed user-friendly software in R for analyzing and integrating different sources of genomic data sets, including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and MNase-seq data (http://github.com/dvera/travis). During my graduate studies, I also developed an approach to profiling multiple aspects of chromatin structure simultaneously (DOI). I also helped develop an approach to cost-effectively profile the chromatin landscapes in the human genome using targeted enrichment and illumina sequencing (DOI).

Upon receiving my PhD, I accepted a position as Director of the FSU Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine because of my deep interest in utilizing diverse types of large-scale biological data to answer important questions surrounding genome biology, including transcriptional regulation, genetic variation, chromatin dynamics, and replication timing. As the Director of a Center focused on genomic data analysis, I have led the analysis of genomic data for many projects, including those that have utilized RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, MNase-seq, Repli-seq, and other types of genomic data. </p>
